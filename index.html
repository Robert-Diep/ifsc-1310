  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessiblility</h3>
  <p>My thoughts on web accessibility is that developers should make their websites or content in way that is 
    usable for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, or disabilities. We should keep 
    in mind of all persons, making it easier for anyone to access and use the website without any trouble. By
    keeping these in mind, we can avoid excluding certain people with disabilities. Also ensuring web accessibility
    from the start can future proof your content, making the website adaptable to changes and technology evolves.
